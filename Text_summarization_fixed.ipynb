as well as shareability, reusability, and discoverability of ML assets.\\n* This includes dataset and feature management, model management, and ML metadata tracking.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\n* MLOps

These capabilities can be provided by a single integrated ML platform. Alternatively, they can be created by combining vendor tools that each are best suited to particular tasks, developed as custom services, or created as a combination of these approaches. In most cases, the processes are deployed in stages rather than all at once in a single deployment. An organization’s plan for adopting these processes and capabilities should align with business priorities and with the organization’s technical and skills maturity. For example, many organizations start by focusing on the processes for ML development, model deployment, and prediction serving. For these organizations, continuous training and continuous monitoring might not be necessary if they are piloting a relatively small number of ML systems. Figure 4 shows the core set of technical capabilities that are generally required for MLOps.
